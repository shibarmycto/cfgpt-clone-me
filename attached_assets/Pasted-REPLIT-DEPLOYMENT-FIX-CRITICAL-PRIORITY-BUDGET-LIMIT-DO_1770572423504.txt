REPLIT DEPLOYMENT FIX - CRITICAL PRIORITY
BUDGET LIMIT: DO NOT EXCEED $5 TOTAL
STOP and ask for approval if cost approaches $3

PRIMARY ISSUE: DOMAIN NOT REFLECTING CHANGES
Problem: All recent changes visible on Replit preview and Expo, but NOT showing on www.cfgpt.com
Required Solution: Make www.cfgpt.com show EXACTLY what appears in Replit preview

WHAT MUST BE VISIBLE ON WWW.CFGPT.COM
All these features MUST work on the live domain for ALL users:
✅ Recent Features to Verify:

Build Tabs - All build sections functional
Earn Credits System - Users can see and earn credits
PayPal Buttons:

£10 monthly bundle
£20 monthly bundle
£5 voice cloning package


AdMob Integration - Ads displaying correctly
ElevenLabs Features:

Voice cloning button (5 credits)
AI Agent widget creator
Widget dashboard
Call timer & credit system


Credit Balance Display - Users see their credits
All User Account Features - Dashboard, settings, etc.


DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
Step 1: Identify Deployment Issue
Check these common problems:

Is deployment pointing to correct domain (www.cfgpt.com)?
Are environment variables set in production?
Is build process completing successfully?
Are static files being served correctly?
Is DNS/domain connection configured properly?
Are there any build errors in deployment logs?

Step 2: Fix Deployment Configuration
Ensure:

Custom domain (www.cfgpt.com) is properly linked
Production build includes ALL recent code changes
No caching issues preventing updates
All API keys work in production environment
Database is accessible from live domain

Step 3: Verify ALL Features Work
Test on www.cfgpt.com (not Replit preview):

 Can users see PayPal buttons?
 Can users purchase credits?
 Does voice cloning work?
 Do widgets display?
 Are ads showing?
 Is credit system functional?


ADMIN DATABASE REQUIREMENT
CRITICAL: Create accessible admin dashboard at www.cfgpt.com/admin
Must display:

All registered users in database table
User download/signup data:

Username/email
Registration date
Credit balance
Subscription status (free/paid)
Last login
Features used


Real-time user count
Transaction history (PayPal purchases)

Access: Secure admin login (provide credentials separately)

CONTEXT: WEBSITE-FIRST STRATEGY
Important Understanding:

www.cfgpt.com is our MAIN PUBLIC WEBSITE right now
We are NOT launching as app yet
Next week: Testing phase before app conversion
This week: Website must be fully functional for customers

Therefore:

All features must work on WEB BROWSER at www.cfgpt.com
Customers will access via website not app
Everything must be publicly accessible
No app-specific code should block website functionality
