TASK 1: RESTORE PAYPAL BUTTONS (Priority: CRITICAL)
Current Issue: PayPal buttons removed, users cannot purchase credits at www.cfgpt.org
Required Actions:

Restore original PayPal button code for:

£10 monthly credit bundle
£20 monthly credit bundle


Verify buttons appear on public site (www.cfgpt.org)
Test credit purchase flow works correctly
DO NOT change any other payment functionality


TASK 2: ADD NEW £5 VOICE CLONING FEATURE
2A: Create New PayPal Button

Add ONE new PayPal button: "£5 - Voice Cloning (5 Credits)"
Must deduct 5 credits from user balance
If insufficient credits, show message: "You need at least 5 credits. Purchase a £10 or £20 monthly pack to use this feature."
Block free trial accounts - require paid subscription

2B: Implement Voice Cloning Feature
API Documentation: https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-api/guides/cookbooks/voices/instant-voice-cloning
Requirements:

Create button: "Clone My Voice (5 credits)"
Button click triggers:

Check user has 5+ credits
Check user is NOT on free trial
Deduct 5 credits from balance
Call ElevenLabs API with YOUR API KEY


Allow voice upload/recording per API docs
Store cloned voice ID to user account
Display success message with voice details


TASK 3: IMPLEMENT AGENT WIDGET FEATURE
3A: Create Widget Generator
API Documentation: https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-agents/quickstart
Requirements:

Add button in user account: "Create AI Agent Widget"
User can create unlimited widgets
Each widget creation uses cloned voice from Task 2
Store all widgets in user's account dashboard
User can select/switch between widgets

3B: Widget Usage & Billing System
Call Cost Structure:

Initial call connection: 10 credits (deducted when call starts)
Additional time: 1 credit per 10 minutes
Maximum call duration: 60 minutes

Timer & Credit Logic:
ON CALL START:
- Check user has 10+ credits
- Deduct 10 credits immediately
- Start visible 60-minute countdown timer on screen

DURING CALL (every 10 minutes):
- Deduct 1 credit
- Update timer display

ON CALL END:
- Calculate actual call duration
- If call < 60 mins, refund unused credits
- Example: 50-min call = 9 credits total (10 initial - 1 refund)
- Display credit summary to user
3C: Widget Display

Embed widget in user account dashboard
Widget must be publicly accessible when shared
Users can test widget from their account
Widget uses selected cloned voice
