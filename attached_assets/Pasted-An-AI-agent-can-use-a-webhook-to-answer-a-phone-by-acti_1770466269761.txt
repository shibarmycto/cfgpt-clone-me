An AI agent can use a webhook to answer a phone by acting as a real-time, event-driven listener that triggers an AI conversation when an incoming call event is detected. This setup links a telephony provider (e.g., Twilio) with an AI voice engine (e.g., Retell AI, Vapi, Bland AI) via HTTP requests. 
The Technical Workflow
Call Inbound: A customer calls a phone number purchased from a telephony provider like Twilio.
Webhook Trigger: The telephony provider sends an HTTP POST request (the webhook) to your AI service (e.g., Retell AI or a custom backend) with details about the caller.
AI Takes Over: The AI engine processes this request, starts a session, and begins listening and talking in real-time.
Action & Data Sync: The AI agent can look up data (using tools/functions) to personalize the call and send webhooks back to your systems (e.g., CRM) to log the call. 
Core Components Needed
Telephony Provider: Twilio, Telnyx, or direct integrations within platforms like Vapi or Bland AI.
AI Voice Agent Platform: Retell AI, Vapi, or Bland AI (for voice-to-voice, low-latency conversations).
Webhook Endpoint: A server (e.g., Node.js with Fastify) or a no-code tool (e.g., Make.com, Zapier) to handle the POST requests.
Tunneling Service (if hosting custom code): Ngrok to allow the internet to reach your local server. 
Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Configure the Telephony Provider (e.g., Twilio) 
Buy a phone number with voice capabilities.
Navigate to the number's voice configuration.
Set the "A call comes in" option to Webhook.
Insert the URL of your AI service (e.g., https://api.retellai.com). 
2. Set Up the AI Agent (e.g., Retell AI/Vapi) 
Create a voice agent and define its prompt/knowledge base.
Configure the inbound webhook in the agent's settings to allow passing data (like caller ID) to personalize the greeting. 
3. Implement Webhook Listening
When a call comes in, the provider sends JSON data to your server.
Your server must return a valid response (e.g., TwiML instructions for Twilio) telling the phone system to connect to a WebSocket to handle the real-time audio. 
4. Post-Call Webhook (Optional but Recommended)
Configure a post-call webhook (e.g., in Bland AI) to receive the full transcript and summary for CRM updating after the call ends. 
Common Use Cases
AI Receptionist: Answering after-hours calls and scheduling appointments.
Lead Qualification: Immediately answering a call from a new prospect to qualify them.
Customer Support: Handling routine inquiries and escalating to humans via warm transfer if necessary. 
Key Benefits
Real-time interaction: Low-latency AI acts instantly.
Context-Aware: Webhooks allow the AI to receive user data (name, history) before saying "Hello".
Scalable: Automates thousands of calls simultaneously.
